# Spring-Cloud


Spring Cloud is a Spring module that provides the RAD (Rapid Application Development) feature to the Spring framework. We can quickly develop cloud-based allocation with the help of the Spring Cloud Framework.

Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to build some of the common patterns in distributed systems quickly. For example, configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, a control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state.

## Why is Spring Cloud used?

Spring Cloud framework provides tools for developers to build a robust cloud application quickly. We can also build the microservice-based applications, for example, configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, cluster state, micro-proxy, a control bus, one time tokens, etc. Using Spring Cloud, a developer can quickly develop services and applications that implement the design patterns. These patterns work well in any distributed environment, including the bear metal data centers, developer's laptop, and managed platform such as Cloud Foundry.

Bear metal data centers: It is a physical server dedicated to a single-tenant (a person who occupies server on rent). These are not shared between the customers. The tenant can optimize the performance according to its needs for performance, security, and reliability. The bare metal data centers are also known as Single-tenant physical server or managed dedicated server. The operating system is installed directly on the bare metal server and delivers better performance.

Cloud Foundry: Cloud Foundry is an open-source, multi-cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). You can deploy your application on your own computing infrastructure.

## Features of Spring Cloud

The great part about Spring Cloud is that it builds the concept of Spring Boot. Spring cloud is built upon some of the common building blocks of Spring framework which are as follows:

- Intelligent routing and service discovery
- Service-to-Service Call
- Load Balancing
- Leadership Election
- Global Locks
- Distributed Configuration
- Distributed Messaging

## Spring Cloud Components

There are the following components:
- Configuration
- Service Discovery
- Circuit Breakers
- Routing and Messaging
- API Gateway
- Tracing
- CI Pipeline and Testing
